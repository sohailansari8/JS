// Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. 
// Conditions typically return true or false, and the loop will continue to execute as long as the condition evaluates to true.

// About the 'for' Loop in JavaScript:
// The 'for' loop is one of the most commonly used loops in JavaScript. 
// It is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand. 
// It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

// // Syntax of 'for' Loop:
// for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
//     // Code to be executed in each iteration
// }

// Example of a 'for' Loop:
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log("Iteration number: " + i);
}
