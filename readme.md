# JavaScript Learning Resources

Welcome to the **JavaScript Learning Resources** repository!  
This repo contains various resources and code examples to help you learn JavaScript effectively.

## How to Use

- The main `index.html` file serves as the entry point.
- To explore different JavaScript concepts, **change the `<script>` tag** in `index.html` to reference the desired JS file.
- Each script demonstrates a specific topic and logs output to the browser console.

## Special Sections

- **Sections 17 and 18** each have their own `index.html` and custom styling files.  
    Navigate to their respective folders to explore these advanced topics with dedicated layouts.

Happy coding!
